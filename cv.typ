= About Me

#entry([
  I am a seasoned professional programmer with more than 20 years of experience in various fields and domains.


  In recent years, I have worked as a Rust HPC programmer in the biotech field, specializing in optimizing the performance and resource usage of biostatistical pipelines.
  My extensive experience as a Scala developer has given me a solid understanding of functional and type-level programming,
  which enables me to deliver robust, high-quality software, that builds on the strengths Rust already offers.

  Additionally, I have completed graduate-level courses in Bioinformatics, Whole Genome (WGS) and Single-Cell Sequencing,
  and Genomic Networks. This formal training demonstrates my passion and dedication to delivering top-quality software,
  as truly effective solutions require a deep understanding of the field.

  My efforts, to a sensible extent, helped biologists to develop at least two molecules for treating orphan diseases,
  and one of them is out of clinical trials.

  Besides that I have contributed to the back-end development of a well-known MMO game, an IoT framework,
  a London minicab automation system, and a bus station automation project.

  The project aim was to learn the structure of biological networks from omics data assessed
  with patient data using a combined constraint-based approach and Bayesian score-based method
  (a framework based on S. Boettcher deal package) in a distributed environment.

  \

  My responsibilies were:
  - Performance optimization and tuning using vtune, mpip, heaptrack, dhat,
    llvm sanitizers, criterion and iai (cachegrind);
  - Algorithms optimization;
  - Porting of R, Python and Wolfram Mathematica scripts, produced by mathematicians to Rust;
  - Contributed missing functionality to `special` crate (tri-gamma function),
    `rsmpi` (group splitting by colors and tags, User Level Failure Mitigation);
  - Design and implementation of auxiliary programs requested by the analytics department;
  - Writing user and programmer guides, software design documents (tectonic, latex, confluence), SOWs;
  - Automation of development and deployment processes (gitlab-ci, docker);
  - HTTP API development using axum, utoipa and http4s for Scala-based services;
  - Implementing automated tests (property, unit, mutation, integration and e2e) and benchmarks (criterion, iai);
  - Onboarding and technical-leading, helping team members to develop professional development plans,
    conducting technical interviews, mentoring and conduction summer schools for rust programmers;
  - Bug fixing in HPC cluster environment (pmpi, vtune);
  - Developing and maintaining open source components required by our software: `kendalls` crate for Kendall’s tau-b rank correlation,
  `hoconlight` crate - a peg parser and deserializer of Akka hocon configuration files.

    The goal of the project was to develop the sales system to be used by call center
    agents to book hotels for the clients.

    \

    Based on different criteria, the system searched hotels in multiple sources providing
    an agent with all relevant information about a client.
    The system utilized microservice architecture, which allowed decoupling all logical subsystem,
    managing and developing them independently of each other.

    Responsibilities:
    - Call dispatching service development that notifies agents about incoming phone calls;
    - Integration with internal CRM system;
    - Next Caller and Piwik integration;
    - Payment gateway integration;
    - Back-end RESTful API development.
